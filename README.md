## README

This is collection of my various configuration files, arranged for use with gnu `stow`.  This replaces my previous repo named `dot-files.git`.

`emergency_vim/vimrc` is a file you can source while loading `vim` on a machine where you don't have all your special configuration files.  E.g., `vim -S vimrc some-file.js`.
